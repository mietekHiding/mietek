# Mietek

> AI assistant in WhatsApp, powered by your Claude Code subscription.
> No API keys. No per-message costs. Just your existing Claude Pro/Max plan.

## How it works

WhatsApp message → Bridge (Baileys) → SQLite queue → Processor (claude -p) → response back to WhatsApp

Three isolated PM2 processes communicate via SQLite:
- **Bridge** — WhatsApp connection via Baileys, message listener & sender
- **Processor** — Invokes Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`), manages context, memory, and commands
- **Heartbeat** — System monitoring, reminders, daily summaries

## What can Mietek do?

🧠 **Top-tier AI, no compromises**
Powered by the best Anthropic model through your Claude Pro/Max subscription. No crippled API tier. No per-token billing. The same Claude you'd use at your desk — now in your pocket.

🔌 **Plugs into your tools**
Connect email, calendar, databases, APIs, and virtually anything else through MCP. Mietek doesn't just answer questions — it takes action on your behalf.

🎯 **Handles real work**
Write code. Analyze data. Draft marketing copy. Research competitors. Plan projects. If Claude can do it, Mietek can do it — all from a WhatsApp message.

💻 **Runs 24/7, controlled from anywhere**
Set it up on any machine and walk away. Mietek keeps working while you're on the go — just text it from WhatsApp whenever you need something done.

🎉 **Bring it into any conversation**
Activate Mietek in group chats, 1:1 threads, anywhere on WhatsApp. Drop an AI into a conversation with friends and watch their reaction.

## Bring AI to Any Chat

> This is Mietek's killer feature.

Most AI chatbots live in their own window. Mietek lives in **your WhatsApp** — and you can summon it into any conversation: a group chat with friends, a 1:1 with your partner, a work thread. Just type:

```
HeyMietek say hello, explain who you are and where you coming from
```

The response goes directly into that chat. Everyone sees it. It feels like you just invited the smartest person in the room.

**Only you can activate it.** Mietek responds exclusively to messages sent from the owner's account (`fromMe`). If someone else in the group types `HeyMietek` — nothing happens. Your friends can't accidentally (or intentionally) trigger it. This is by design: your Claude subscription, your rules.

> Per-chat permissions (allowing specific people to invoke Mietek) are on the roadmap but not yet implemented.

The trigger word is customizable — set `TRIGGER_WORD` in `.env` to whatever you want.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mietekHiding/mietek.git
cd mietek
npm install
npm run setup    # Interactive wizard: prerequisites, WhatsApp QR, Claude CLI test
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
```

Send a WhatsApp message to yourself — Mietek will respond!

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Code CLI** installed & authenticated (`claude -p` must work)
- **PM2** — `npm i -g pm2`
- **WhatsApp account** — Mietek connects as a linked device

## Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│    Bridge     │─────>│  SQLite  │<─────│  Processor   │
│  (WhatsApp)  │<─────│  (queue) │─────>│  (claude -p) │
└──────────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────────┘
                           ^
                      ┌────┴─────┐
                      │ Heartbeat│
                      │ (monitor)│
                      └──────────┘
```

- **Bridge** polls DB for completed responses, sends via WhatsApp
- **Processor** polls DB for pending messages, invokes `claude -p`
- **Heartbeat** runs system checks, fires reminders, generates daily summaries
